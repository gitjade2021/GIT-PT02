# GIT-PT02

Create a simple webpage displaying information about three universities, along with their logos and links to their websites.

Instruction:

1. Create a new folder on your computer to organize your project files. Label it as 'PT02' for identification.
2. Inside the "PT02" folder, create a subfolder named "images" to store the university logos. Place the MMSU, UP, and Harvard University image files in this folder. Ensure the image filenames match those used in the example code (MMSU.png, UP.png, and harvard.png).

3. Create an index.html file to work on the activity.
3.1. Make sure you use the appropriate attributes for each identified HTML tag.
3.2. Adjust the MMSU logo to have a height of 200 and a width of 300. Configure the UP logo to have a height of 230 and a width of 250. Similarly, for the Harvard logo, set a height of 230 and a width of 250. Ensure that these images are centered on your screen and apply a 5% top margin, 0 bottom margin, and auto left and right margins.
3.3. Apply heading level 1 and center-align all university names with a font size of 150% and set both margin and padding sizes to 0 for each university name.
3.4. Apply the specified hexadecimal color codes for highlighting the university names as follows: MMSU - #FFB800, UP - #8D1436, Harvard - #C90016.
3.5. The university website should be clickable which will allow the user to check the website of each university. The hyperlink should be italicized, enclosed in a paragraph tag, center-aligned and set both margin and padding sizes to 0. Each university should have the following link assigned: MMSU - https://www.mmsu.edu.ph, UP - https://up.edu.ph, and Harvard - https://www.harvard.edu. Apply also different value for the target property as follow: For MMSU apply the blank value, for UP self value, and for Harvard use top value.

Note: Avoid using the ceneter tag in this activity.
